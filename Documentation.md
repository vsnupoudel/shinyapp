## Final Assignment of Developing data Products course ( coursera)

In this project, I will compare the *outputs and coefficients* of the **lm** function from the **stats** package 
to the **train** function from the **caret** package. 

I will run these two functions on the same data in order to generate two similar linear models. 

- We will compare the coefficients and p values of the resulting model.

- Additionally, in the shiny web application I built, we can manually enter the input values, 
in order to compare the outputs/predictions of these models.

## Link to the Shiny web application is given below:
